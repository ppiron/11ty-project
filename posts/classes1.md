## Piano Lessons for Children

Music activities are very beneficial for brain development. It is acknowledged that children learning to play a musical instrument develop better concentration, memory, language, mathematical and reading skills as well as self-esteem, self-discipline and emotional intelligence.

Pupils are encouraged to learn through a process of exploration and discovery that ignites imagination and creativity. Children learn to set their own goals, work independently and manage their home practice time.

I provide a solid foundation in piano technique and musicianship so that my students are empowered to explore any kind of music and realize their highest potential.

**Practise and Instrument**

Students are expected to practise regularly on a well maintained acoustic piano or full size (88 keys) digital piano.

**Parental involvement**

Parents are encouraged to attend and quietly observe lessons and help children to set up a regular practise routine at home.
