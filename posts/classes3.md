## Piano Lessons for Intermediate and Advanced Levels

After learning the basics of music and piano technique students are introduced to world famous classics and explore others styles and genres of music. Students learn to practise effectively and continue to work on their technical and musicianship skills alongside with practical music theory and history.

Students can choose to study towards a recognized music qualification: ABRSM, LCME or Trinity exams or simply play the music they enjoy without taking any exams!

Performance opportunities are provided for students who wish to perform. Many of my students enjoy playing in Studio Concerts, Edinburgh Festival, EPTA workshops and masterclasses and other public events.

### Intensive Grade 5 Music Theory Course

For those students who would like to focus on Music Theory and prepare for Grade 5 Exam I offer intensive Theory Lessons.
