## Welcome to AllegranDo: Piano Lessons in Edinburgh and Online!

I am a fully qualified and enthusiastic piano teacher that has been successfully teaching children and adults for 20+ years. I offer piano lessons to students of all ages and abilities at my piano studio in Edinburgh and anywhere in the world via the Internet.

My mission is to inspire the lifelong joy of playing piano and self-expression through music! I encourage students to develop fundamental technical and musicianship skills to become independent learners and accomplished pianists.
